description: This work was borne out of a recognition that one main method to model spatial correlations in terrain - Gaussian process regression - is typically only applied to elevation, especially in the context of planetary rovers. Elevation-based models work well for orbital images, since the sensor noise is well aligned with the terrain height. However, for a ground-based rover, perception sensors will record data at an oblique angle to the terrain, meaning the sensor uncertainty also has components in the x and y directions. Range-based Gaussian process maps model range measurements directly as a function of the inclination and azimuth of the ray along which an observation was taken, enabling correct modeling of uncertainty along with incorporation of spatial correlations. Work has thus far focused on local mapping for LiDAR sensors.

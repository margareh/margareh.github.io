[MoonRanger](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/moonranger/) is a microrover designed by Astrobotic to search for volatiles (ice) at the south pole of the moon. 


As part of this project, I designed, authored, and tested the mapping component of the flight software, in addition to being an active participant in integrated testing of the autonomous navigation software on a prototype rover. The mapping software is based on older designs that rely on terrain meshes, with improvements such as edge detection in disparity images to ensure higher preservation of points of interest. Integrated testing occurs in the Moonyard test bed in the Planetary Robotics Lab at CMU and has included such diverse tasks as using motion capture to track ground-truth location of the robot, validating the mapping system against dense ground truth information produced by a FARO scanner, and performing repeated iterations of parameter modification and testing.
